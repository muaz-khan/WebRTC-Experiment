## Realtime/Working [WebRTC Experiments](https://www.webrtc-experiment.com/)

1. It is a repository of uniquely experimented WebRTC demos; written by <a href="https://github.com/muaz-khan">Muaz Khan</a>!
2. No special requirement! Just WebRTC compatible web-browser (e.g. chrome/firefox/opera on desktop/android)
3. These demos/experiments are entirely client-side; i.e. no server installation needed!
4. You can use all these demos in PHP/Python/Ruby/ASP.NET/etc. everywhere!

## How to use?

**Each demo has a unique directory. Simply download that directory, upload in your webserver and use it; and it'll work!**

You don't need to modify any single line to use it. No single installation or modification is needed :)

## [Translator.js](https://github.com/muaz-khan/WebRTC-Experiment/tree/master/Translator.js) / [Demo](https://www.webrtc-experiment.com/Translator/)

Translator.js is a JavaScript library built top on Google Speech-Recognition & Translation API to transcript and translate voice and text. It supports many locales and brings globalization in <a href="https://www.webrtc-experiment.com/">WebRTC</a>!

```html
<script src="//cdn.webrtc-experiment.com/Translator.js"> </script>
```

```javascript
var translator = new Translator();

translator.voiceToText(function (text) {
    console.log('Your voice as text!', text);
}, 'your-language');

translator.translateLanguage(textToConvert, {
    from: 'language-of-the-text',
    to: 'convert-into',
    callback: function (translatedText) {
        console.log('translated text', translatedText);
    }
});

translator.speakTextUsingRobot(textToPlay);

translator.speakTextUsingGoogleSpeaker({
    textToSpeak: 'text-to-convert',
    targetLanguage: 'your-language'
});
```

## [FileBufferReader.js](https://github.com/muaz-khan/FileBufferReader) / [Demo](https://www.WebRTC-Experiment.com/FileBufferReader/)

FileBufferReader is a JavaScript library reads file and returns chunkified array-buffers. The resulting buffers can be shared using WebRTC data channels or socket.io.

```javascript
var fileBufferReader = new FileBufferReader();

fileBufferReader.readAsArrayBuffer(file, function(uuid) {
    // var file         = fileBufferReader.chunks[uuid];
    // var listOfChunks = file.listOfChunks;
    
    // get first chunk, and send using WebRTC data channels
    // NEVER send chunks in loop; otherwise you'll face issues in slow networks
    // remote peer should notify if it is ready for next chunk
    fileBufferReader.getNextChunk(uuid, function(nextChunk, isLastChunk) {
        if(isLastChunk) {
            alert('File Successfully sent.');
        }
        // sending using WebRTC data channels
        datachannel.send(nextChunk);
    });
});

datachannel.onmessage = function(event) {
    var chunk = event.data;
    
    if (chunk instanceof ArrayBuffer || chunk instanceof DataView) {
        // array buffers are passed using WebRTC data channels
        // need to convert data back into JavaScript objects
    
        fileBufferReader.convertToObject(chunk, function(object) {
            datachannel.onmessage({
                data: object
            });
        });
        return;
    }
    
    // if you passed "extra-data", you can access it here:
    // chunk.extra.senderUserName or whatever else
    
    // if target peer requested next chunk
    if(chunk.readyForNextChunk) {
        fileBufferReader.getNextChunk(chunk.uuid, function(nextChunk, isLastChunk) {
            if(isLastChunk) {
                alert('File Successfully sent.');
            }
            // sending using WebRTC data channels
            datachannel.send(nextChunk);
        });
        return;
    }
    
    // if chunk is received
    fileBufferReader.addChunk(chunk, function(promptNextChunk) {
        // request next chunk
        datachannel.send(promptNextChunk);
    });
};
```

## [getScreenId.js](https://github.com/muaz-khan/WebRTC-Experiment/tree/master/getScreenId.js) / [Demo](https://www.webrtc-experiment.com/getScreenId/)

Simply use <a href="https://github.com/muaz-khan/WebRTC-Experiment/tree/master/getScreenId.js">getScreenId.js</a> and enjoy screen capturing from any domain. You don't need to deploy chrome extension yourself. You can refer your users to install <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/screen-capturing/ajhifddimkapgcifgcodmmfdlknahffk">this chrome extension</a> instead. Also, <a href="https://github.com/muaz-khan/WebRTC-Experiment/tree/master/getScreenId.js">getScreenId.js</a> auto-fallbacks to command-line based screen capturing if chrome extension isn't installed or disabled. <a href="https://github.com/muaz-khan/WebRTC-Experiment/tree/master/getScreenId.js">getScreenId.js</a> throws clear exceptions which is helpful for end-user experiences.

```html
<script src="//cdn.WebRTC-Experiment.com/getScreenId.js"></script>

<script>
getScreenId(function (error, sourceId, screen_constraints) {
    navigator.getUserMedia = navigator.webkitGetUserMedia || navigator.mozGetUserMedia;
    navigator.getUserMedia(screen_constraints, function (stream) {
        document.querySelector('video').src = URL.createObjectURL(stream);
    }, function (error) {
        console.error(error);
    });
});
</script>
```
